**SYSIS provides a simple way to retrieve and display system information across multiple system types, by eliminating the need to use multiple commands that vary based on system-type.**  It is especially useful for sys-admins, developers and IT Professionals that frequently connect to multiple systems and require immediate knowledge of the current hosts info.

It was designed for maximum productivity:
- Simple to use - it requires no parameters to use
- Executes quickly by gathering only commonly needed information
