**SYSIS provides a simple way to retrieve and display system information across multiple system types, by eliminating the need to use multiple OS specific commands.**  It is especially useful for sys-admins, developers and IT Professionals who maintain  simultaneous connections to multiple hosts, as it allows rapid retrieval of system info for any host.

It was designed for maximum productivity:
- Simple to use and requires no parameters to use (no parameters to research learn and memorize)
- Executes quickly by focusing on the most commonly needed information
- Includes Network Connection Details - Adapter Name, IPv4 (if assigned), IPv6 (if assigned), and MAC Address
  - Details on Network Info are described in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/robertpeteuil/sysis/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

### macOS with 2 NICs: "en1" with IPv4 & IPv6, "en2" with IPv4

### Ubuntu with 1 NIC: "enp0s10" with IPv4 & IPv6

### Supported Platforms:

  - Linux
  - macOS (OS X)
  - Windows 10 'Bash on Windows'  
  - Embedded Devices running Linux

### Installation:

The script itself is a single Bash script, so there are many ways it can be installed: downloading and running the installer, cloning the repo locally and running the installer, or manually downloading it.
- Using the installer is recommended, as it installs the latest release
- Downloading the script manually retrieves the latest commit on the master branch 

**Download and Run Installation Script (requires `curl`):**
- Download the installation script
- Verify the contents of the script you downloaded matches the contents of install.sh
- Run the installation script
- The installation script downloads the latest release and installs it in the path.

``` shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robertpeteuil/sysis/master/install.sh -o install.sh
sh install.sh
```

**Install by cloning the repo and running installer locally:**
- clone the repo, optionally specifying `--depth=1` to make the download fast and use less disk space
- cd into the repo directory
- run the installation script
- The script will detects that it's running locally and use the downloaded copy of `sysis`, instead of downloading it

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/robertpeteuil/sysis.git --depth=1
cd sysis
./install.sh
```

**Install by manually downloading the script and placing it in the $PATH (requires `curl`)**
- This method downloads the latest commit on master, whereas the installation script downloads the latest release.

``` shell
curl -s -L https://raw.github.com/robertpeteuil/sysis/master/sysis > sysis; chmod +x sysis
```

### Hosted Script Execution and Security

For the purpose of this utility, there are two scenarios where executing a script directly from GitHub is desirable:
- executing the installation script
  - this makes for an extremely simple, one-step install
- executing `sysis` without installation
  - this is enables use of the utility on hosts where installation is not possible

In general, executing hosted scripts is not secure because the scripts are executed without a chance to inspect them. Fortunately, the security risks can be mitigated by performing actions specific to each scenario.

**Preperations for Using Hosted Installation Script**
This is the easier of the two scenarios to address because you will only run the installer once and don't need to consider future changes.
- review the [installer](https://github.com/robertpeteuil/sysis/blob/master/install.sh) and ensure its safe and meets your security standards
- After review, the hosted installation script can be executed with the command below.  
  - This is the equivalent of the first installation option, but performed in one step.

The online-installation command:
``` shell
bash -c "`curl -s -L https://raw.github.com/robertpeteuil/sysis/master/install.sh`"
```

**Preparations for Using Hosted `sysis` Script**
- Review the [sysis script](https://github.com/robertpeteuil/sysis/blob/master/sysis) and ensure its safe and meets your security standards
- Create a fork of this repo in your GitHub account
  - This provides an isolated copy that you control and allows you to review all future commits before [syncing them to your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).
  - In your fork, edit `install.sh` and change the value assigned to `REPOACCT` to your username.  (This ensures that running the installer in your fork will look for releases in your fork.)
  - Change the username in the command below so the script runs from your fork.
- For ease of use, you will likely want to create an alias or terminal macro to execute the command:

``` shell
bash -c "`curl -s -L https://raw.github.com/robertpeteuil/sysis/master/sysis`"
# remember to change 'robertpeteuil' to your account name if you've created a fork
```

### Project History:

**SYSIS**, an acronym for "SYStem IS", was originally written in 2014 and released as open-source in 2017. It's actively maintained and enhancements are continually added.
